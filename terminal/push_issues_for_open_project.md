## RoadMap

Just use GitHUb repository for an example.

1.Go to the project repository on GitHub and click on the `Issues` tab.

2.Search to see if an issue similar to yours has already been reported. If you

find a similar issue, you can add your comments to that issue.

3.If your issue is unique, click the `New issue` button.

4.Write a descriptive title and a detailed description of the issue you are

facing. Include any relevant information that might help the project

maintainers understand and reproduce the issue, such as screenshots, error

messages, or steps to reproduce the issue.

5.Optionally, you can use labels and milestones to categorize your issue. This

will help the maintainers to better organize and prioritize the issues.

6.Once you have written the issue, click the "Submit new issue" button to

create the issue.

After you have submitted the issue, you can track its progress on the issue

page. The project maintainers will review your issue and may ask for more

information or clarification. If you have more information to add, you can add

it as a comment to the issue. If you want to contribute to the project by

fixing the issue, you can check the project's contribution guidelines and

submit a pull request with your fix.
