## RoadMap

Just use GitHub for an example.

1.Fork the project repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the `Fork`

button on the project page.

2.Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git.

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git

3.Configure the account name and email address.

    git config user.name "Sofija_Personal_GitHub"
    git config user.email "sofijapersonal@gmail.com"

4.Create a new branch for your changes.

    git checkout -b bugfix-my-branch

5.Make the necessary changes to the code in your local copy. Be sure to follow

any contributing guidelines provided by the project.

6.Test your changes to ensure that they work as expected.

7.Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

    git add .
    git commit -m "fixed bug #XYZ via target file"
    git push origin bugfix-my-branch

8.Go to your forked repository on `GitHub` and create a new `pull request`. In

the pull request description, explain the changes you made and why they are

necessary.

9.Wait for the project maintainers to review and merge your pull request. If

there are any changes that need to be made, make the changes locally and push

them to your forked repository, then update the pull request.

Once your pull request has been merged, your changes will be included in the

main project repository for everyone to use.
