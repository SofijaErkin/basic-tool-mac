## RoadMap

1.Click the Newest `Eclipse Installer`, e.g: the newest `The Eclipse Installer 2023‑03`,
move the "`Eclipse Installer.app`" into `Applications`;

2.Find and click "Eclipse Installer" APP via `LanuchPad`, choose `Open` button while
prompt "`“Eclipse Installer.app” is an app downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?`";

3.I choose the version "Eclipse IDE for Enterprise java and web" to continue Because I will use `Spring`,
please choose the version "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" to continue if you only `Java` Developer,
click the "`!`" button on the right top display windows, click the "`Advanced Mode`" menu which prompt on the
left of "`Eclipse Installer`" display window;

4.Click the "`Up and down`" button on the right of  "`Product Version`" menu, choose that version of 
"Product Version" which let the below of "`Product Version`" menu shows "`Java 1.8+ VM`", e.g: the recent version
of "Product Version" which support "`Java 1.8`" is "2020-06", and "`Java 11+ VM`" is "`2022-06`";

5.Then click the "`Up and down`"button on right of "`Java 1.8+ VM`", choose and click "`/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home`", and then `Next`.
