## Nice tips to using IntelliJ Idea

Use the Smart code completion `⌃⇧Space` after the `new` keyword to instantiate

an object of the expected type(IntelliJ IDEA Community tips, #153).

To evaluate any expression while debugging your program, select the expression

in the editor and press `⌥F8`.

IntelliJ IDEA allows you to easily call a Java code from Kotlin and vice versa.

You can narrow down the list of code completion suggestions by using camel case

prefixes.
