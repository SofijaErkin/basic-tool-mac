## Nice tips to using IntelliJ Idea

Use the Smart code completion `⌃⇧Space` after the `new` keyword to instantiate
an object of the expected type(IntelliJ IDEA Community tips, #153).
To evaluate any expression while debugging your program, select the expression
in the editor and press `⌥F8`.
IntelliJ IDEA allows you to easily call a Java code from Kotlin and vice versa.
You can narrow down the list of code completion suggestions by using camel case
prefixes.
You can remove breakpoints by dragging them from the gutter. To configure this
option, open settings by pressing `⌘,`, go to `Build, Execution, Deployment |`
`Debugger`, and select `Drag to the editor or click with middle mouse button`.
When you click a breakpoint, you toggle the breakpoint status (enabled or
disabled).
Get access to the most common breakpoint actions and filters through intention
actions (`⌥⏎`).
Kotlin is a powerful, concise and expressive language crafted by JetBrains.
IntelliJ IDEA supports it out-of-the-box.
To create a Kotlin file, right-click the target folder, and choose the
corresponding option on the New menu.
If you position the caret at a symbol and press `⌃T`, the list of refactorings
applicable to the current context will open.
Press `F2` or `⇧F2` to jump to the next or previous error respectively in the
current file.
Press `⌥F7` to quickly locate all occurrences of code referencing the symbol at
the caret, no matter if the symbol is a part of a class, method, field,
parameter, or another statement.
You can view all statements within the method where certain exceptions can be
thrown. Place the caret at the `throws` statement and press `⇧⌘F7`.
The Extract Variable refactoring wraps the selected expression into a variable.
It adds a new variable declaration and uses the expression as an initializer.
To invoke this refactoring, select the expression and press `⌥⌘V` `(Refactor |`
`Extract | Variable)`.
