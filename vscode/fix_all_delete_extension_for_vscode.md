# Fix All Deleted Extensions for VSCode

Yesterday I've accidentally deleted all my VSCode extensions because I did not know how to fix the below trouble.

    Found that duplicate Database Client extensions are installed, please uninstall the duplicate!
I did know that was because two version of XYZ-SQL extensions while I deleted all my VSCode extensions,

but that's too late! So, I have to reinstall all my VSCode extensions again.

That XYZ-SQL are `name_vscode-redis-client_publisher_cweijan_version_6.3.1` and

`name_vscode-mysql-client2_publisher_cweijan_version_6.3.1`.
