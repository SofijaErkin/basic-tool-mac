1.download

There are three ways to install MySQL on MacOS: Install using Docker; Use 

Homebrew to run brew install mysql to install; Use the installation package 

to install.

I use the installation package to install, because this installation method 

is more intuitive and controllable, such as the choice of MySQL version and 

password configuration, so let's start next.

home website: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

download website: https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/


It is not recommended to download the latest version, whether you are a 

student or an industrial industry.

Each system version of Mac has its suitable mysql version sequence. For 

example, macOS 10.12 can install mysql version from 5.7.16 to 5.7.22.

Therefore, in the mysql download page, my Product Version chooses 5.7.18, 

of course the Operating System is macOS, and the installation package 

selection is macOS 10.12 (x86, 64-bit), DMG Archive, click download directly.

Since I downloaded mysql in 2017, please choose the corresponding mysql 

version according to your Mac system version, or the latest version of mysql 

is not recommended.


2.install

Find the downloaded mysql mirror installation package in the downlaod of your 

mac's Finder, 

double-click the mysql-5.7.18-macos10.12-x86_64.dmg file to load the image;

double-click mysql-5.7.18-macos10.12-x86_64.pkg to start the installation.

(1)After double-clicking to run the downloaded pkg, click Continue;

(2)After reading the software license agreement, click Continue;

(3)Click install;

(4)Remember the initial password of the installed database (it is better to 

save the screenshot, my initial password is: M7Rju)ofMFMb);

(5)The installation is successful, click close.

The installation process is very simple, just pay attention to a pop-up window 

during the installation process, this window gives the initial password of MySQL 

randomly generated by the system, this password is very important, will be used 

later, be sure to save it.
