You know, after MySQL is uninstalled and reinstalled via homebrew, it will prompt: 1. Upgrade to macOS 10.13; 2. Upgrade to Xcode 9.2.
If you don't want to upgrade the system or Xcode version, then request the MySQL official website to download:

The MySQL version suitable for macOS 10.12 ranges from 5.7.17 to 5.7.23.
