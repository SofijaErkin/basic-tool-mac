# Trouble Under Updating Software On Mac

## 1.MacBook System Software

### 1.1Suggestion

1.Do not use the automatically update status.

2.If the system softwares do not work quickly, or some usage need the latest

system, then update the macbook operation system.

### 2.RoadMap

1.Maybe the system software automatically download while connecting the wifi;

2.Now restart the mac to install the latest version spending about ten minutes.

## 2.Xcode

### 2.1Download

1.Downloading Xcode from AppStore needs about 30 minutes(Just use the 8GB APP

for an example). Also, that depend your network speed.

2.Or downloading Xcode Package from AppleDeveloper spend up to 2 hours. Also,

that depend your net-speed.

### 2.2Install

As we al know, installing xcode needs about 5 hours to 7 hours.

But it is worth to do that.

### 2.3Problem

#### 2.3.1Two Xcode icon

Both of the two Xcode icon are the same version in my Mac. I've just moved the

second Xcode icon from Launchpad to the Trash, and I try that first, that

worked! But after a few minutes, My first Xcode missed!

So, Please do not directly move any of the Xcode icon to the trash. Because that

will delete the Xcode, and you again need to download.
