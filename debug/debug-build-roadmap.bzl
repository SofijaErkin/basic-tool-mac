# Debug Manually

This is a roadmap of building debug via Vim and VS Code on mac, maybe include 

GDB(Docker/Cloud services).

## ABOUT LINUX(DOCKER/CLOUD)

It doesn’t make any practical sense to talk about this issue out of the actual 

usage scenario.

Consider the following different usage scenarios:

1.You maintain a game project, the game will be suspended for three hours a 

week for maintenance.

`It is recommended to use Windows.`

Using `Windows Servers` can effectively reduce the cost of operation and maintenance. 

If a small company lacks professional operation and maintenance personnel and wants 

to save money, windows is really good. It is cheaper to buy a `Win server` than to 

hire an operation and maintenance personnel (it is difficult for people with reliable 

`win` operation and maintenance...).

Now the stability of `windows server 2012` is already good, and the deployment service 

is faster than `linux`, and the new version of `powershell` is also very powerful.

But for Internet companies, stability means continuous profitability. I have to say 

that `Linuxn is really stable`. I joined an Internet company and never saw a `windows` 

`server` again.

2.You maintain a telecommunications system. If there is a problem with this 

system, people in a city cannot access the Internet or make phone calls.

`It is recommended to use AIX or Solaris `

It is said that China Telecom uses `SUSE`.

3.You maintain an airport dispatch system. If there is a problem with this 

system, the plane may crash, and you will be in the headlines.

`It is recommended to use the system recommended by the manufacturer.`

4.What you maintain is a commercial software purchased from another 

manufacturer that is not open source. This software was developed under the 

RedHat system. The manufacturer stated that it has not tested the execution 

under other systems.

`RHEL is recommended`

5.You are maintaining the products developed by your own company. The 

company’s technical staff are very trendy and like to use a lot of the latest 

technology and functions.

`Recommend to use Debian/Ubuntu.`

And,

Trendy means that it relied on -std=c++14 three years ago and now relies on 

`-std=c++17`.

Or, rely on `CUDA 6` three years ago and now rely on `CUDA 10`.

`It doesn't need to be re-implemented. Many new technologies are backward `

`compatible.`

6.The product you maintain has not been updated for seven years, and it is 

unlikely to be updated in the future.

`It is recommended to use whatever the company uses now.`

7.The product you maintain can only support MySQL 4, but cannot support the new 

version of MySQL. The developer has left for a long time and cannot be changed.

`It is recommended to use whatever the company uses now.`



Can the operating systems selected in these scenarios be the same? Any scene can 

be done with a certain operating system, so why don't other operating systems die?

`You can focus on one or two releases, but you must also understand some other `

`releases.`

The general solution is "Format GNU/Linux in Ten Seconds".
