# A Beginner's Guide to Back-End Development

## 1.What is Back-End development?

Backend includes all the code needed to build out the database, server, and

application. From database migrations to API integrations to setting up the

server-side technologies that make a website tick, a back-end web developer

may be the talent you need to get your next web project off the ground.

## 2.Front-end vs back-end development

To understand the back end, or the “server side,” you also have to know the

front end and how the two interact. The front end, also called “client-side”

programming, is what happens in the browser—everything the end users see and

interact with. The back end, on the other hand, happens on the server (on site,

or in the cloud) and databases. It’s the machinery that works behind the

scenes—everything the end user doesn’t see or directly interact with, but that

powers what’s happening.

It’s important to note that this convenient way of divvying up development has

changed significantly over the past 10 to 15 years with the explosive growth of

JavaScript, which wasn’t as ubiquitous on the front end as it is now, or as

common on the back end, thanks to Node.js. There’s more overlap between the

two, especially when it comes to a JavaScript developer’s role on a fully

JavaScript-powered stack.

You can see how the server-side (in the green box) manages all those requests

that come from users’ clicks. Front-end scripts volley those requests over to

the server side to be processed, returning the appropriate data to the front

end. This often happens in a constant loop of requests and responses to the

server.

The “traditional” back end is a mix of the server, databases, APIs, and

operating systems that power an app’s front end. For an in-depth look at the

software that ties it all together, read our article on Server-Side Scripting.

The back end of applications can look very different from application to

application, whether it’s the use of cloud-based servers and data warehouses,

containerization with a service like Docker, Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)

providers, or APIs to replace more complex processing.

## 3.Types of back-end languages

### 3.1C++

combines all the features of C with object-oriented programming features

such as classes. As a low-level programming language it is used to communi

-cate efficiently with system hardware for better performance. This makes it

ideal for video games, large web applications, and other use-cases where

system-level performance is a premium.

### 3.2PHP

is the most popular back-end language for the web. PHP has a low learning

curve and the benefit of a massive codebase and long history of open-source

developer community support for using PHP on the back end of websites. If

you’ve ever set up a personal website with WordPress, PHP was powering the

back end from behind the scenes.

### 3.3Ruby

Developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, Ruby is a

dynamically-typed general-purpose programming language that’s known for

programmer productivity. It supports procedural, functional, and

object-oriented programming paradigms and is known for its ability to

incorporate metaprogramming into apps (code that can change while it's running).

### 3.4Perl

Developed by Larry Wall in the 1990s, Perl is a general purpose programming

language that’s popular in the Linux and Unix world. Perl’s strengths lie in

text manipulation and log management. It’s great for writing short automation

scripts on the fly.

### 3.5JavaScript

While traditionally considered a front-end scripting language, the introduc

-tion of Node.js showed the world that this general-purpose object-oriented

programming language could also be used on the server-side of applications.

As one of the core technologies of the web, JavaScript is now a popular

choice for front-end and back-end web development.

## 4.Back-end tools & technology

To simplify things, we’ll break the server side down into four main components of a

“software stack”: the server, the database, the operating system, and the software.

(1).Of your back-end stack’s four components, whether it’s on-site or in the

cloud,the server acts as the lifeblood of the network. These high-powered

computers provide shared resources that networks need to run, including file

storage,security and encryption, databases, email, and web services. Once

you’ve gotten the basics down about on-site servers, expand your knowledge with

a look at virtualization, how servers get provisioned to house multiple apps,

and containerization, another way servers provision their operating systems out

to house compartmentalized applications.

(2)Databases, in the context of a website, are the brains that make websites

dynamic. Any time you request something from a website—whether you’re searching

for a product in an online store or searching for hotel locations within a

specific state—the database is responsible for accepting that query, fetching

the data, and returning it to the website. Databases can also accept new and

edited data when users of a website or application interact with them. The

client can change information in a database from the browser, whether a user is

posting articles to a CMS, uploading photos to a social media profile, or

updating their customer information.

In this quick Guide to Modern Database Technology, you’ll get an understanding

of how databases work, common terms to know, a look at SQL vs. NoSQL, and how

to determine which database is best for your web application.

(3)Middleware essentially describes any software on the server that connects an

application’s front end to its back end. Think of middleware as plumbing for

your site—it pipes any communication, like requests and responses, back and

forth between your application and your server/database. Just like plumbing in

a house, you don’t see middleware, but it’s there and it has to be reliable and

always do what’s expected of it.

Middleware (server-side software) facilitates client-server connectivity,

forming a middle layer between the app(s) and the network: the server, the

database, the operating system, and more. Middleware can be multi-layered,

organized into different layers of a site, whether it’s the presentation layer

or the business layer. This is also where Web APIs can play into the stack,

providing a bridge between the business layer and presentation layer.

Middleware also lets cloud applications and on-premise applications “talk,” and

provides services like data integration and error handling. Good middleware can

also maximize IT efficiency and power things like user engagement, business

process management, content management, authentication, and more. Koa.js is an

example of a server-side JavaScript framework.

Next, we’ll talk about some of the programming languages and frameworks used to

build different types of middleware, APIs, and server-side software.

(4)You can’t talk about the back-end portion of an application these days with

-out touching on APIs (application programming interfaces) and how they connect

software, applications, databases, and services together seamlessly. APIs play

an integral role in how most server-side software architectures are built,

oftentimes replacing more complicated programming to allow software to communi

-cate and data to be transferred.

To help explain the power of APIs, Upwork wrote the free ebook “The API Economy”

that covers all you need to know to get started with APIs. Download it for free.

"Common skills needed for back end development"

## 5.Common skills needed for back end development

Now that you know what back-end development involves, let’s distill these concepts into a list of skills a back-end developer should possess.

    (1)Basic understanding of front-end technologies HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

    (2)Working knowledge of back-end development (configuration, administration and management of databases and servers)

    (3)Server-side languages (e.g., PHP, C#, Java)

    (4)Database technologies (e.g., MySQL and SQL)

    (5)Security and authentication best practices

    (6)Experience writing RESTful APIs

## 6.Common back-end development jobs

Back-end development is an umbrella term that refers to the server-side of any

application (not just websites). The fundamentals of understanding how to build

the back-end of an application can thus be applied to a number of different

professions. Let’s took at the most common back-end development roles:

    (1)Back-end web developers: The most common job for back-end developers is to

    build the back end of a website. They are responsible for building and
    
    maintaining the database, server, and business logic behind a website.

    (2)Full-stack developers: Full-stack developers have a working knowledge of 
    
    both the front-end and back-end of a technology stack. On small projects 
    
    they may be the sole developer building a minimum viable product. On larger
    
    projects they are team leaders assisting with integration between the front
    
    and back end of an app.

    (3)Java developers: From websites to desktop applications, back-end developers
    
    who specialize in Java are in high-demand in the enterprise app industry.

    (4)Software developers: Depending on the job description, this could be another
    
    Java developer job or any of the other languages we listed above. Software
    
    development roles usually refer to non-website applications such as desktop apps. 

## 7.Hiring a back-end developer

## 8.Others

[Is PHP front or back end](https://catwebmedia.com/qa/question-is-c-front-end-or-backend.html)

PHP belongs to the LAMP stack, which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/

Perl/Python.

To develop a web app with this technology stack, a software engineer needs to

know four different syntax systems, as well as HTML and CSS.
