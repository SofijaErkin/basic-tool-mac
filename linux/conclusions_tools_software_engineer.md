those.

PHP5.X is friendly with Debian 7/8, Ubuntu 12/14.

## 1. Commands Or Plug-ins

### 1.1 rsync(command)

Transform/Transmit and sync the data/code between local and remote.

### 1.2 [spell check](https://ostechnix.com/use-spell-check-feature-vim-text-editor/)(command)

VSCode just use Extension `Code Spell Checker`  and `Grammarly (unoffical)`.

[vim for writers](https://hackernoon.com/vim-for-writers-ee15d2a8f512).

Config spell in Vim under `/usr/share/vim/vim81/spell`.

Need to type the command inside Vim session.

`:help spell`: know more about spell check feature.

`:set spell` : enable spell check.

`:set nospell` : disable spell check.

`]s` : find the misspelled word after the cursor (forward search).

`[s` : find the misspelled word before the cursor (backward search).

`]S` :  (note the capital "`S`") - Similar to "`]s`" but only stop at bad words,

not at rare words or words for another region.

`[S` : similar to "[s" but search backwards.

`z=` : find suggestions for the that particular word (then type number `XXX` and

`ENTER` replace that misspelled word).

`:wq` : save the changes and quit Vim editor.

`:set spell spelllang=en_us` : set spell language to US English.

(Terminal session) `$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/spell/` and

`:set spellfile=~/.vim/spell/en.utf-8.add` : enable add words to spellfile.

either `[s` or `]s` and type `zg`. It will add the word under the cursor as good word

in spellfile.
