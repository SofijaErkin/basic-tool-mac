# Fix VirtualBox on Mac

This is a notebook to write about installing virtualbox on mac, mostly fix

problems during installing. It's time to say bye to Parallels Desktop, for me.

I'm a elder user of Parallels from 2017 up to now, and pay year in  and year

out. My mac again upgrade to macOS 12.3.1 this year. And now $49.99/¥358 is

need to upgrade Parallels. I'm jobless. You know, it's doesn't matter how much

Parallels do that cost when I'm on job. $49.99/¥358, for me, it's too luxury

and too expensive. Got down on my knees, VirtualBox.
