# Fix VirtualBox on Mac

This is a notebook to write about installing virtualbox on mac, mostly fix

problems during installing. It's time to say bye to Parallels Desktop, for me.

I'm a elder user of Parallels from 2017 up to now, and pay year in  and year

out. My mac again upgrade to macOS 12.3.1 this year. And now $49.99/¥358 is

need to upgrade Parallels. I'm jobless. You know, it's doesn't matter how much

Parallels do that cost when I'm on job. $49.99/¥358, for me, it's too luxury

and too expensive. Got down on my knees, VirtualBox.

## 1. Problem A

display output:

    The virtual machine 'Linuxdemo' has terminated unexpectedly during startup with exit code 1 (0x1).

    back code: NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)

    part/unit: MachineWrap

    window: IMachine {85632c68-b5bb-4316-a900-5eb28d3413df}

Fixed.

click `apple` logo, select "`System Preferences`", chose "`Security & Privacy`"

, click "`General`", click your locked `lock` logo, just input your mac pass

-word, then you will see "allow Virtual box XXX" or "allow Oracle XXX", shoot

or check that mark on the right of the upstairs showing news.
