# Text Editor

## 1.Vim

Simple navigation.

## 2.Nano

A legitimately reverent appreciation for Nano's intuitive interface.

Save and exit a file using nano editor:

1.To exit and save the file, start by pressing `Ctrl + X` on your keyboard.

This will attempt to exit nano. To remember this keyboard combination, check

the bottom of the nano menu. `^X` just means `Ctrl + X`.

2.You’ll now be asked if you want to save your changes to the file. You need to

respond by entering either “Y” or “N”. Since we are trying to save our changes,

press “Y” and hit enter.

3.Next, you’ll be asked to give a name to the file. If you’re trying to

overwrite an existing file with your current changes, then you can simply hit

enter on your keyboard. Otherwise, fill out a new file name.

## 3.Emacs

Yet to find anything lacking in GNU Emacs.

`Ctrl+X` and `Ctrl+C` save and exit file.
