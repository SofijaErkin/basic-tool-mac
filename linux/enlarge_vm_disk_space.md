# Enlarge VirtualBox VM Debian disk space

When we create VMs on VirtualBox, we may choose automatically distribute disk

space, but that auto-distributed disk space has been limited by the VirtualBox.

For example, I just create a virtual machine Debian use VirtualBox on MacOS.

The new VM Debian get 12GB disk space, but a few days later, all the 12GB has

been used by Debian. Thus, I need to manually enlarge the disk space of VM

Debian because the notifications says "Low Disk Space This computer has only

245.3MB disk space remaining.".

## 1.Manually Enlarge Virtual Size

### 1.1 Using VirtualBox Media Manager On Host/VirtualBox

First, click the VirtualBox APP using your TrackPad; Second, find out the menu

of 'VirtualBox' on the right of the apple logo; Third, find the menu of 'File'

on the right of menu 'VirtualBox'; Fourth, click the menu 'File' and choose

"Virtual Media Manager" to click; Fifth, change the number of 'Size', e.g:

'20.00GB'. Sixth, click 'Apply' to make sure. Seventh, click `close` to exit.

But I suggest that enlarge triple size of the current disk space. E.g:'30GB'.

## 2.Manually Change VM Partition

After I adjust the disk space of the VM, the Debian also says: "Low Disk Space"

and "This computer has only 244.7MB disk space remaining", I just use `df -h`

to check the actual usage of disk space:

    Filesystem     1K-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on
    
    /dev/sda1        11G   11G     0 100% /

As I see, the disk space of VM Debian is the same size. So I'm not able to

access any of this space yet.

That means the VM do not recognize the new enlarged partition, that's the guest

VM can not use the new free space, so I need to manually change the partition

of VM Debian, this's I will now eed to extend the VM Debian's partition.

Changing or resizing the partition of the VM guest's partition use `GParted`.

Just simple boot the GParted ISO image in my VM or install GParted via apt on

terminal if my VM have enough disk space.

Because I have no more than one byte on my VM Debian, I just use the GParted

live CD's ISO file.

### 2.1 Via GParted on VM Debian

1.Download the ISO file of GParted from [Org](https://gparted.org/download.php).

2.Loading the GParted ISO.

First, shut down the VM Debian;

Second, click APP VirtualBox to enter and right click to choose the `setting`

menu;

Third, click `Storage` and find out `Controller: SATA` to click;

Fourth, choose the button `Adds optional drive` and click `Add`;

Fifth, choose ISO `gparted-live-1.4.0-5-amd64.iso` with `Open` button to load and

click `gparted-live-1.4.0-5-amd64.iso` and click 'Choose' button.

Sixth, click `Ok` button to start settings.

But once start the VM Debian, that only display one light down space. Because

there is no disk space for Debian and quit Debian during upgrade software, this

time I can not use graph playstation GParted to manually extend the partition

of VM Debian.

3.If you can use the GParted to manually enlarger your extended disk space,

### 2.2 Via command On Terminal(Repartition a disk space on a remote VM)

Once quitting the VM Debian during upgrading software or others, there only

have a light down space. So I need use `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Fn`(n from 1 to 6).

The `n` under `Fn` dependent the work station of VM. Just my Debian use `F2`.

After `"Ctrl" + "ALt" + "F2"` are being touched, the VM will enter the terminal

status.

Just use the uer name and password to login the VM.

As the terminal shows after I type `sudo fdisk -l`:

    Disk /dev/sda: 30 GiB, 32212254720 bytes, 62914560 sectors
    Disk model: VBOX HARDDISK
    Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disklabel type: dos
    Disk identifier: 0x50c3fc86

    Device     Boot    Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
    /dev/sda1  *        2048 23164927 23162880   11G 83 Linux
    /dev/sda2       23166974 25163775  1996802  975M  5 Extended
