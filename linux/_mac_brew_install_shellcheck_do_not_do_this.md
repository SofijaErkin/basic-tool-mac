# Mac Brew Install Shellcheck(DO NOT DO LIKE THIS)

Do not use `brew` to install `shellcheck` on mac, please.

That installed `python@3.9` make my `Vim` in trouble. So I need to uninstall

`python@3.9`, and roll back `python3` to `python@3.7`. Also, uninstall all the

installed package during `brew install shellcheck`.

This Gist includes 3 file, `this` markdown, "`brew_uninstall_ghc.md`", and

"`install_shellcheck_on_mac_brew.md`".

Markdown "`install_shellcheck_on_mac_brew.md`" is that the terminal road

map output lines during using `brew` to install `shellcheck`.

Also, "`brew_uninstall_ghc.md`" is the roadmap of uninstalling all package via

`brew` installing.
