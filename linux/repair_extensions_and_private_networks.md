#### 2.1.2System of Process

Just download and install the `I2P` on that [website](https://geti2p.net).

Just download reseed file from the reseed source [fr](https://reseed-fr.i2pd.xyz/) and [pl](https://reseed-pl.i2pd.xyz/),

and upload the reseed file on [the configuration of I2P's reseed](http://127.0.0.1:7657/configreseed),

to find other routers when you first install I2P.

If you want to browse hidden websites ('eepsites') on the I2P network, you need

to configure your browser. E.g: use `firefox` browse the I2P network, use

`chrome` to browse the other network.
