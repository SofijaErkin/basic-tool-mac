# The purgeable space on macOS

## 1.Question

I have gone to bed before using `TimeMachine` to backup my mac and accidentally

clicked the `Back Up Automatically` button on the setting of `Time Machine`

yesterday night. I have found my mac only has `60 GB` free space on Disk

Utility this morning. But the Storage tab of my mac shows `100 GB` free space.

What happens to my macbook from yesterday night to this morning?

## 2.Analysis

I do nothing about my macbook except backing up my mac. I calculate all the

usage storage of types and add to only `90+ GB` used disk, where is the other

more `90+ GB` used space going to? Maybe there are some snapshots on the local

of my mac. ALso, `Disk Utility` shows `90+ GB` purgeable space. So, how to deal

with that purgeable space?
